# big-data-university-project

I have done two projects related to big data.
1. House price prediction model, using kaggle data:
2. Tesla stock price prediction model, using kaggle data:

### Developing Tools
These projects are created with Python, Scikit-learn, and Tensorflow.

### Technology
In the house price prediction model, I have used:
* Data visualization (HeatMap)
* XGBoost
* Random Tree Regressor
* MinMaxScaler (feature normalization)

In the Tesla stock price prediction model, I have used:
* Data visualization (HeatMap)
* Dimensionality reduction (delete Open, High, Low, CLose, and Adj Close)
* Feature creation (dayOfWeek)
* MinMaxScaler (feature normalization)
* Long short-term memory (LSTM)
* Cross-validation (training set=72%, validation=8%, test set=20%)
